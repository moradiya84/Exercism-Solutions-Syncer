# To avoid the use of magic numbers (see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_(programming)), you should define a PREPARATION_TIME constant.
# You can do that on the line below the 'EXPECTED_BAKE_TIME' constant.
# This will make it easier to do calculations, and make changes to your code.

    Parameters:
        number_of_layers (int): The number of layers in the lasagna.
        elapsed_bake_time (int): Time the lasagna has been baking in the oven.
    
    Returns:
        int: The total time elapsed (in minutes) preparing and baking.

    This function takes two integers representing the number of lasagna 
    layers and the time already spent baking the lasagna. It calculates 
    the total elapsed minutes spent cooking (preparing + baking).
